# Calculator

This calculator is my first finished projects in vanilla JavaScript. Calculator has 7 mathematical symbols wchich we can use to
mathematical operations. These symbols is %,1/x,Â¬,Ã·,Ã—,+,-. We have 2 avaliable ways to work with calculator, first is operation without equal sign(=).
After our first operation, when we get a result we can work on it, more precisely if now we click another math symbol we will get result of previous and 
depending on the clicked sign. For example I clicked in sequence "55", "+", "11" and next "+". We get result "66 +" and we can start next operation.<br>

Second way is operation with equal sign, for example I clicked again sequence "55", "+", "11", but now instead "+" I was click "=" and we get result in bottom section and components
from which our result was created.<br>

Apart from mathematical symbols we also have "C" button and "UNDO" button. First button remove all contents from calculator, second button remove only last sign which we put in calculator.
I think this calculator is ready for upload to public side with readme, but I know there are bugs on it, that is why I put on side contact form, which make it easier search any bug for me. Most part of the code
is PHP, because I using PHPmailer to forms on side.
